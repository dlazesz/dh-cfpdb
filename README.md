## Setup

1. [Setup the Personal Access Token-based access to Github](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) enabling ```repo``` scopes (shortcut: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new watch out for expiration time!)
2. Set [the proper github repository name (the HTTP variant of the remote url)](https://help.github.com/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use/), github username and the newly created token in `repo_config.yaml` ([see example](repo_config_example.yaml))
3. Setup a scheduled task to run the update:

    - Create a virtualenv and install the dependencies: `virtualenv venv && ./venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - Type `crontab -e` to create a scheduled task.
    - Type the following to run at 1:00 AM every day (see [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru) for examples): `0 1 * * * HOME=$HOME $HOME/cfpdb/venv/bin/python $HOME/cfpdb/update_cfpdb_on_github.py >> $HOME/cfpdb/update.log 2>&1`
    - (Optional) Run the program manually and push the changes: [`update_cfpdb_on_github.py`](update_cfpdb_on_github.py)
    - (Optional) Run the program manually to see the changes locally: [`generate_calendar.py`](generate_calendar.py)
    - (Optional) Run the program on Heroku: [`clock.py`](clock.py)

  - Login to Heroku from the CLI
  - Create an app
  - Clone the repository
  - Add Heroku as remote origin
  - Setup the program (see step 1 and 2)

  - Enjoy!

## Architecture

There are three independent (orphan) branches in this repository:

- _main_: contains the program and the setup instructions
- _conferences_: contains _conferences.yaml_ which stores the conference data (it is meant to be edited by the collaborators)
- _gh-pages_: stores the rendered html file for the calendar to be shown as https://USERNAME.github.io/REPONAME

The updater process fetches `conferences.yaml` from the _conferences_ branch in this repository and pushes the rendered html to the _gh-pages_ branch.

## New features

- iCalendar file (.ics) generation which can be subscribed to (see description)
